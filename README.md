# Veterinary Reference Guide

The <b> Veterinary Reference Guide</b> is a program created to help me work with web based applications. Here I am working on a program for veterinarian nurses to use as a quick glance Reference Guide for inOffice use. I did this because I have family in the field and I wanted to give something to help my wife practice.<br/>*This is still a work in progess and is not finished.* <br/><br/> If you have any question please contact me. <br/> Thank you, Tate

Program started out as a quiz to help vets study information. The program has shifted into a Reference Guide.
